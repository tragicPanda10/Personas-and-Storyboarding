    <p style="padding: 0rem 8rem;">
      The purpose of this project was to practice collecting real information to understand how users interact with an interface.
      By doing so, we can develop products or features that will serve users in the best ways possible.

        All three observed users swiped their cards at the printing station. The swipe changed the screen to the printing queue page.
        The amount of time between this page and the completion of printing varied between about 20 seconds to 5 minutes.
        One user brought her computer to the printer and appeared to be modifying a document before printing her paper.
        Another person swiped into the computer then walked back to his laptop at his desk. The queue page had several files on it.

        Hector is a junior at Brown. He has class in 30 minutes and needs to print his draft for review.
        In his haste, Hector forgets to format his pages perfectly before uploading them. He is forced to fix
        the mistakes from his laptop and reupload everything instead of being able to do so from the interface. 
        Hector represents the cohort of users that are familiar with using the printers at Brown but also face the 
        time challenges that university has. His forgetfulness could stem from stress of finals, fatigue from all-nighters,
        or social pressures, which are all highly relevant issues to Brown students.

          Nate is a new student and has never used the printer at Brown before. He struggles with the unfamiliar 
          process of queuing a printing job from the computer as well as which settings can be changed or not.
          Where settings can be changed is also important and not straightforward. Nate doesn't know where he can
          print his papers around campus, either. His limited knowledge of the interface slows down how fast he's
          able to print, which could be problematic for close deadlines. 
          Nate is representative of new users, which is a large proportion of the user base since nearly 1600 
          freshman learn to use the printers each year. As a new user, Nate's biggest problem is unfamiliarity; 
          the way to print papers takes at least a few times to get used to it, and some people will need help
          their first time printing.

      <p class="text-start">
        By observing users interacting with the printers and interviewing them, the way that students used the Brown printing system
        was able to be recorded. Using that information, two personas representing specific groups of users were created.
        The personas gave a framework and expectation for how a typical user might be expected to interact with the printer, and 
        that framework was used to illustrate the full user experience of printing from the perspective of one of the personas.
        This approach makes potential areas of improvement easier to identify as well as revealing areas where developers and 
        users have conflicting viewpoints in terms of usage.
